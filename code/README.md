## code 

Codes for Monte-Carlo and finite element simulations.
See the README files in the subdirectories for more details.

### Content
- `BlumeCappelKagome/`: Monte-Carlo simulation of our custom spin model on
the honeycomb lattice.
- `IsingAF/`: Monte-Carlo simulation of the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model
on the triangular lattice.
- `FiniteElement/`: Finite element simulation of the Toner-Tu equations in
an oblong geometry, using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/).
